# Spectral-Warping

We provide a script (`Spectral-Warping/fm_warp.m`) to do the spectral warping of a speech signal. In the script you can change the paramter/scale to modify spectral position of a speech signal. This we have used to augment the original data with spectral modified data for ASR training.
